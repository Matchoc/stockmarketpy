Ideas for inputs (in no particular order or logic) :
 - Positive or negative news rating
 - "age" of news (expressed as a number of days since trading result ?)

   2. Parse news articles and add content to word count
   3. Fetch twitter feed with tag $<symbol>
   4. Create new separate machine for twitter results.
   5. Create compound machine with news result and twitter results.
