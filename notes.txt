 todo :
   0.3 Only add dictionary words to all_word (remove all those mdf and ids that make no sense (even if it lowers accuracy ?))
   0.5 Try to fix link errors when downloading news (user-agent, post ?)
   1. work on presentation (would be nice to output a table that I could import in excel and sort by price variation, percentage variation, symbol, news date, etc.)
   3. Fetch twitter feed with tag $<symbol>
   4. Create new separate machine for twitter results.
   5. Create compound machine with news result and twitter results.
   6. Improve machine with new inputs :
     - average price (previous, 1w, 1y ?)
	 - market cap vs share value
   7. take into account national holidays so go back until I get a valid date when training ?
