Ideas for inputs (in no particular order or logic) :
 - Positive or negative news rating
 - "age" of news (expressed as a number of days since trading result ?)
 - keywords count ? (increase, good, performance, decrease, cut, buy, sell, etc?)
 - average price over the last 2 days, 5 days, 1 years, 5 years ?
 - number of days going up/going down
 - market cap vs share value
 - twitter feed about ticker (symbol)
 
 todo :
   1. work on presentation (would be nice to output a table that I could import in excel and sort by price variation, percentage variation, symbol, news date, etc.)
   3. Fetch twitter feed with tag $<symbol>
   4. Create new separate machine for twitter results.
   5. Create compound machine with news result and twitter results.
   6. Improve machine with new inputs :
     - average price (previous, 1w, 1y ?)
	 - market cap vs share value
   7. take into account national holidays so go back until I get a valid date when training ?
