(PLI.TO) (PFSCF), (\"ProMetic\" or the \"Corporation\") announced today that its orally active lead drug candidate, PBI-4050, has been granted an orphan drug designation status for the treatment of Alstr\u00f6m Syndrome (\"AS\") by the European Commission. The European Medicines Agency (\"EMA\") determined that the intention to treat AS with PBI-4050 was justified based on the preliminary clinical data generated in AS patients showing an improvement in liver fibrosis. ProMetic is currently investigating the effects of PBI-4050 on multiple organs in AS patients in an ongoing open label Phase 2 clinical study in the UK. \"The positive results in patients with AS nicely complement those already observed in our other trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes\" commented Dr. John Moran, ProMetic's Chief Medical Officer.",
