(PLI.TO) (PFSCF), ("ProMetic" or the "Corporation") announced today that its orally active lead drug candidate, PBI-4050, has been granted an orphan drug designation status for the treatment of Alstr&#246;m Syndrome ("AS") by the European Commission. The European Medicines Agency ("EMA") determined that the intention to treat AS with PBI-4050 was justified based on the preliminary clinical data generated in AS patients showing an improvement in liver fibrosis. ProMetic is currently investigating the effects of PBI-4050 on multiple organs in AS patients in an ongoing open label Phase 2 clinical study in the UK. "The positive results in patients with AS nicely complement those already observed in our other trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes" commented Dr. John Moran, ProMetic's Chief Medical Officer.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/1751496410</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2017 12:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>ProMetic Life Sciences, Inc. &#8211; Value Analysis (TORONTO:PLI) : January 12, 2017</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/xcapitalcube/rss/SIG=13h1dmqlp/*http://www.capitalcube.com/blog/index.php/prometic-life-sciences-inc-value-analysis-torontopli-january-12-2017/</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/3058154824</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2017 15:05:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>ETFs with exposure to ProMetic Life Sciences, Inc. : January 11, 2017</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/xcapitalcube/rss/SIG=13d9u2skc/*http://www.capitalcube.com/blog/index.php/etfs-with-exposure-to-prometic-life-sciences-inc-january-11-2017/</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/813707539</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2017 18:10:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>ProMetic Life Sciences, Inc. breached its 50 day moving average in a Bullish Manner : PLI-CA : January 11, 2017</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/xcapitalcube/rss/SIG=14lmnenah/*http://www.capitalcube.com/blog/index.php/prometic-life-sciences-inc-breached-its-50-day-moving-average-in-a-bullish-manner-pli-ca-january-11-2017/</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/1005094825</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2017 13:15:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>PROMETIC REACQUIRES PLASMINOGEN RIGHTS FROM HEMATECH</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/noodlsaunz/rss/SIG=128bpnk4d/*http://www.publicnow.com/view/E528264C741E9E899DB639CEB878E74FACB9ED08</link><description>[at noodls] - Regains 100% ownership of profits from future sales of plasminogen for congenital deficiency Hematech continues to hold Taiwanese rights to PPPS&#8482; as CMO supplier to ProMetic LAVAL, QUEBEC, CANADA, - January ...</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/3226595884</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2017 11:44:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>ProMetic reacquires plasminogen rights from Hematech</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/prometic-reacquires-plasminogen-rights-hematech-113000941.html</link><description>[CNW Group] - ProMetic reacquires plasminogen rights from Hematech</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/4171651808</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2017 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>ETFs with exposure to ProMetic Life Sciences, Inc. : December 27, 2016</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/xcapitalcube/rss/SIG=13eg1f1v8/*http://www.capitalcube.com/blog/index.php/etfs-with-exposure-to-prometic-life-sciences-inc-december-27-2016/</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/336493335</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2016 18:40:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>PROMETIC INITIATES ROLLING SUBMISSION OF ITS BIOLOGICS LICENSE APPLICATION (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) FOR PLASMINOGEN WITH U.S. FDA</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/noodlsaunz/rss/SIG=1288q90vf/*http://www.publicnow.com/view/4A4A43B5DAEB1CFC7D6938B39F5AD8CEFE8A4CBC</link><description>[at noodls] - LAVAL, QUEBEC, CANADA, - December 19, 2016 - ProMetic Life Sciences Inc.
