Lukama's former employer, South Africa's AngloGold Ashanti (Xetra: AOD.DE - news) , had for years sought to develop the 3,260 square kilometre Mongbwalu concession but pulled out partly due to concern over the sprawling blue-tented camps full of miners. When he led a buyout of AngloGold's 86 percent stake in the Mongbwalu Gold Mine (MGM) last year, Lukama knew he couldn't chase them away if he was to succeed in mining any of the 2.5 million ounces of gold estimated to lie trapped in the earth.",
