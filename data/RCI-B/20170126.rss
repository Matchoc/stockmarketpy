The watchdog launched a probe into Apple's business practices in December 2014 to investigate allegations the company's Canadian unit had used anti-competitive clauses to force domestic operators to sell rival devices at higher prices than they otherwise would have and restricting how they could market and sell iPhones. "The Bureau did not find evidence to suggest that the Apple terms resulted in a significant effect on competition," the antitrust watchdog said in a statement.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/2846786354</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2017 15:52:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Rogers Communications, Inc. breached its 50 day moving average in a Bullish Manner : RCI.B-CA : December 30, 2016</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/xcapitalcube/rss/SIG=14nph4j17/*http://www.capitalcube.com/blog/index.php/rogers-communications-inc-breached-its-50-day-moving-average-in-a-bullish-manner-rci-b-ca-december-30-2016/</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/1349627567</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2016 13:36:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Rogers Communications 4Q16 Investment Community Teleconference January 26, 2017 at 8:00 AM ET</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/noodlsaunz/rss/SIG=128fqrpuu/*http://www.publicnow.com/view/6BAE396A0E38BBE780AC73E5C4317660211D9599</link><description>[at noodls] - TORONTO, Dec. 22, 2016/CNW/ - Rogers Communications Inc., Canada'sleading diversified communications and media company, plans to release its fourth quarter 2016 financial results on Thursday, January 26, ...</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/2464298836</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2016 22:08:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Rogers Communications 4Q16 Investment Community Teleconference January 26, 2017 at 8:00 AM ET</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/rogers-communications-4q16-investment-community-220000968.html</link><description>[PR Newswire] - TORONTO, Dec. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Rogers Communications Inc., Canada's leading diversified communications and media company, plans to release its fourth quarter 2016 financial results on Thursday, January 26, 2017 before North American financial markets open.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/2888574891</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2016 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Rogers Communications 4Q16 Investment Community Teleconference January 26, 2017 at 8:00 AM ET</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/rogers-communications-4q16-investment-community-220000609.html</link><description>[CNW Group] - Rogers Communications 4Q16 Investment Community Teleconference January 26, 2017 at 8:00 AM ET</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/1095281271</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2016 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Telecom Stock Roundup: Verizon May Revise Yahoo Deal Terms, Rogers Communications Opts for X1</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/telecom-stock-roundup-verizon-may-213509149.html</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/2809933053</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2016 21:35:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Canada telecoms regulator rules broadband basic service, sets up fund</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/canadas-telecom-regulator-makes-broadband-213004147.html</link><description>[Reuters] - Broadband internet access will be considered a basic service in Canada, the country's telecom regulator ruled on Wednesday, paving the way for universal access to high-speed services in rural and isolated areas of the country. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) said it was establishing a fund providers will pay into to invest C$750 million ($560 million) over five years to build or upgrade broadband infrastructure to improve access in underserved areas. The CRTC set a target download speed of 50 megabits per second, 10 times its previous, and recommended providers offer unlimited data for fixed broadband.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/3880221150</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2016 23:35:10 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
