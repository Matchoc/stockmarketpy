The upsized Glacier plant expansion has minimal impact on the Corporation's 2017 capital expenditure budget due to Advantage's proven expertise in cost efficient facilities engineering design, lower construction costs and fewer required wells to grow and maintain production compared to earlier estimates.",

This eight well pad was designed to evaluate increased frac stages, longer horizontal laterals and cost efficiencies related to continued optimization of our well operations and larger pad sizes specifically in the Lower and Middle Montney formations. The Corporation's third quarter 2016 production increased 44% to 215 mmcfe/d (35,760 boe/d), representing production growth per share of 33% compared to the same period in 2015 and up from 210 mmcfe/d during the second quarter of 2016. Liquids production increased to an average 1,200 bbls/d (80% C5+) and is expected to remain flat to slightly lower in the fourth quarter due to Pembina Pipeline Corporation's planned maintenance work in October 2016.",
