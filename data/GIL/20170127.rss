Gildan said on Tuesday it will buy manufacturing equipment and intellectual property rights related to American Apparel, but the Canadian company did not assume the leases of the retailer's California manufacturing plants, fueling questions over where the clothing will be produced. Reuters reported late on Monday that Gildan had won the auction, which also attracted bidders such as California-based apparel maker Next Level Apparel and had garnered interest from Amazon.com Inc and Forever 21 Inc.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/45417938</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 23:22:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>American Apparel's 'made in U.S.' heritage uncertain after deal</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/gildan-wins-american-apparel-auction-065313505.html</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/1992319702</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 20:51:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>American Apparel's 'made in U.S.' heritage uncertain after deal</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/gildan-wins-american-apparel-auction-065313947.html</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/4141252209</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 20:51:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Second time&#8217;s the charm for Gildan&#8217;s bid for American Apparel</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/bizj/rss/SIG=139nh3fjk/*http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2017/01/10/second-time-s-the-charm-for-gildan-s-bids-for.html?ana=yahoo</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/2595051054</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 19:45:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>[$$] American Apparel Sells Brand to Gildan</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/wsj/rss/SIG=12ocgglpq/*http://www.wsj.com/articles/bankrupt-american-apparel-sells-brand-to-gildan-1484053126?mod=yahoo_hs</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/1106180842</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 16:16:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>American Apparel Bankruptcy Deal Leaves Retail Future in Doubt</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/bloomberg/rss/SIG=13j0kgfdr/*http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-10/american-apparel-goes-canadian-as-gildan-buys-assets-at-auction?cmpid=yhoo.headline</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/1002270724</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 13:25:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Gildan Wins Auction to Purchase American Apparel</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/tsmfe/rss/SIG=1326lrrl1/*https://www.thestreet.com/story/13948098/1/gildan-wins-auction-to-purchase-american-apparel.html?puc=yahoo&amp;cm_ven=YAHOO</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/4148731881</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 12:59:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Canadian apparel maker Gildan wins auction to buy American Apparel</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/canadian-apparel-maker-gildan-wins-122305184.html</link><description>[Reuters] - Canadian apparel maker Gildan Activewear Inc said it had won a bankruptcy auction to buy U.S. fashion retailer American Apparel for about $88 million in cash.

Gildan's takeover marks the end of an era for the iconic Los Angeles-based company, which was founded in 1998 by an eccentric Canadian university drop-out and grew to become a part of U.S. popular culture thanks to its racy advertising. Gildan will not take any of American Apparel's 110 stores, but will own its brand and assume some of its manufacturing operations, the source said.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/2298640095</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 04:42:53 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
