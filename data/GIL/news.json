Gildan said on Tuesday it will buy manufacturing equipment and intellectual property rights related to American Apparel, but the Canadian company did not assume the leases of the retailer's California manufacturing plants, fueling questions over where the clothing will be produced. Reuters reported late on Monday that Gildan had won the auction, which also attracted bidders such as California-based apparel maker Next Level Apparel and had garnered interest from Amazon.com Inc and Forever 21 Inc.",
