"The danger comes from what's not wrapped &#8211; the entertaining, travelling, or even tempting Boxing Day sales and New Year's festivities," says David Nicholson, Vice-President, CIBC Imperial Service. Albertans will spend 6 per cent more this season at $688, while Ontarians and Quebecers cut their holiday shopping budgets by 12 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/3105962882</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2016 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Record-breaking $7 million raised on 32nd #CIBCMiracleDay to support kids in need</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/record-breaking-7-million-raised-195500584.html</link><description>[PR Newswire] - Charities, celebrities and CIBC unite to help make miracles happen for children's charities TORONTO, Dec. 14, 2016 /CNW/ - CIBC (CM: TSX) (CM: NYSE) announced today that the 32nd CIBC Miracle Day raised $7 ...</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/692377641</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2016 19:55:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Record-breaking $7 million raised on 32nd #CIBCMiracleDay to support kids in need</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/record-breaking-7-million-raised-195500119.html</link><description>[CNW Group] - Record-breaking $7 million raised on 32nd #CIBCMiracleDay to support kids in need</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/2219693675</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2016 19:55:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Dodig: Willing to Wait Out Rally on PrivateBancorp Deal</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/bloomberg/rss/SIG=138h3ujjp/*http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-12-13/dodig-willing-to-wait-out-rally-on-privatebancorp-deal?cmpid=yhoo.headline</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/3861721247</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2016 00:04:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>CIBC Willing to Wait Out Rally on PrivateBancorp Deal, CEO Says</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/cibc-willing-wait-rally-privatebancorp-174418386.html</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/1869656889</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2016 17:44:18 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
