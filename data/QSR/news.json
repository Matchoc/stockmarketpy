Restaurant Brands International Inc, which owns both chains, said it aims to make the change in U.S. stores in 2017 and in Canada in 2018. An estimated 70 percent of antibiotics that are important to fighting human infections and ensuring the safety of invasive procedures such as surgeries are sold for use in meat and dairy production.",

        "description": "[AAP] - Burger King's parent company said the fast-food chain's sales rose during the first quarter, boosted by the addition of hot dogs to the menu in the US. Restaurant Brands International said global sales rose 4.6 per cent for established Burger King locations, including a 4.4 per cent increase in the US and Canada. CEO Daniel Schwartz declined to specify how much of the increase was driven by an uptick in customer visits, versus higher spending per visit.",
