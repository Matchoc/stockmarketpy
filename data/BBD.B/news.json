While the aid was far less than the $1 billion originally sought by the Canadian plane and train maker, Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare called it the right level of support, saying the company's financial situation had improved. The move risks exacerbating trade wounds with rival jetmaking nation Brazil, which has already threatened to take Canada to the World Trade Organization over a $1 billion injection by Quebec for the CSeries.",

        "description": "[Reuters] - Canada's federal government on Tuesday announced C$372.5 million ($283 million) in repayable loans for two of Bombardier Inc's jet programs, far less than the $1 billion originally sought by the Canadian plane and train maker. The loans, which come from a Canadian aerospace and defence fund targeting research and development projects, will be used for Bombardier's CSeries family of narrowbodies and the Global 7000 business jet, according to a statement from the government. \"The repayable contributions announced today will help to ensure that Canada remains at the centre of Bombardier's research and development activities,\" Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare said in a statement.",

The assistance from the government could trigger a new trade dispute with Brazil, which said late last year it would start proceedings against Canada at the World Trade Organization over what it calls unfair support. Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer SA have battled for decades over the regional jet market.",
