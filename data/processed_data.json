The TIARA-I trial is assessing the safety and performance of the Tiara\u2122 mitral valve system and the implantation procedure in high-risk patients suffering from severe mitral regurgitation. With respect to the Company's other cardiovascular device, the Neovasc Reducer\u2122, for the treatment of Refractory Angina, Dr. Gregg Stone presented the Reducer as the most effective treatment option for patients suffering from refractory angina despite optimal medical therapy. He reviewed the results of the COSIRA randomized study which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine last year. He also outlined the design of the COSIRA II, pivotal US trial, which will include 380 patients and will be a multicenter prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial.",
