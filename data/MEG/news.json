Calgary-based MEG plans to spend C$590 million ($447.85 million) this year, up from C$125 million in 2016 when the company deferred some production growth projects because of low crude oil prices. A number of Canadian oil and gas producers have laid out plans to spend more in 2017 as global crude prices stabilise above $50 a barrel.",
