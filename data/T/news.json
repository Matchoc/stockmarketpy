The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) said it was establishing a fund providers will pay into to invest C$750 million ($560 million) over five years to build or upgrade broadband infrastructure to improve access in underserved areas. The CRTC set a target download speed of 50 megabits per second, 10 times its previous, and recommended providers offer unlimited data for fixed broadband.",
