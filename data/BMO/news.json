Deal value climbed 8.3 percent to $250.7 billion last year, from 2015 levels, according to data released by Thomson Reuters. A number of large transactions, including Enbridge Inc's planned acquisition of Spectra Energy Corp for about $28 billion and a proposed merger between fertilizer producers Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc and Agrium Inc, drove deal activity to the second strongest year on record, after 2007.",
