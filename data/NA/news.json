        "description": "[Reuters] - National Bank of Canada on Friday reported better-than-expected profit for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year and said it planned to further strengthen its capital position next year. Canada's sixth-biggest bank based on assets raised C$300 million ($226 million) through a share offering last year after its core tier 1 ratio, a key measure of financial strength, fell to the 9.5 percent minimum required by the country's financial regulator. Since then, it has rebuilt its capital buffer to 10.1 percent at the end of October and Chief Executive Louis Vachon said he wanted to continue that progress and bring the bank's core tier 1 ratio up to 10.5 percent.",
