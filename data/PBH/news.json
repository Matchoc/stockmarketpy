Since then, they have grown the Diana's Seafood name, which is synonymous with high quality fresh seafood, into an iconic brand in the Greater Toronto Area. \"We are very excited about Diana's joining our rapidly growing Seafood Group business platform,\" said Mr. George Paleologou, President and CEO of Premium Brands. \"This platform, which has grown from virtually no sales in 2007 to over $135 million in projected sales for 2016, is benefiting from a number of consumer trends including increased consumer awareness of the health benefits associated with a seafood rich diet and Canada's changing demographics, both in terms of age and ethnic mix. The Diana's transaction, which is our Seafood Group's fifth acquisition, moves this platform one step closer to its objective of building Canada's only national seafood distribution network,\" added Mr. Paleologou.",
