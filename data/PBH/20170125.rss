Since then, they have grown the Diana's Seafood name, which is synonymous with high quality fresh seafood, into an iconic brand in the Greater Toronto Area. "We are very excited about Diana's joining our rapidly growing Seafood Group business platform," said Mr. George Paleologou, President and CEO of Premium Brands. "This platform, which has grown from virtually no sales in 2007 to over $135 million in projected sales for 2016, is benefiting from a number of consumer trends including increased consumer awareness of the health benefits associated with a seafood rich diet and Canada's changing demographics, both in terms of age and ethnic mix. The Diana's transaction, which is our Seafood Group's fifth acquisition, moves this platform one step closer to its objective of building Canada's only national seafood distribution network," added Mr. Paleologou.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/1690849425</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2016 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Premium Brands Holdings Corporation announces acquisition of Diana's Seafood</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/premium-brands-holdings-corporation-announces-120000205.html</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/636865592</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2016 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Premium Brands Holdings Corporation Announces Completion of $100,000,000 Financing of 4.60% Convertible Unsecured Subordinated Debentures</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/premium-brands-holdings-corporation-announces-125500953.html</link><description /><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/1188815916</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2016 12:55:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Premium Brands Holdings Corporation announces acquisition of Island City Baking, Conte Foods and Larosa Fine Foods</title><link>http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/news/rss/story/*http://finance.yahoo.com/news/premium-brands-holdings-corporation-announces-120000999.html</link><description>[PR Newswire] - Conte Foods, which was founded in 1993, is a distributor of a variety of specialty food products including items imported from various parts of Europe and fresh pasta produced at its new 16,000 square foot facility located in Burnaby, BC.
