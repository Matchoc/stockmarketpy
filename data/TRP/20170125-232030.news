(NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe executive orders issued by President Donald Trump on Tuesday related to the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipeline projects were greeted with high praise by a domestic oil and gas industry that has become conditioned to expect nothing but bad news from the federal government over the past eight years. That reaction is certainly appropriate - it is always a good sign whenever any president makes taking positive steps related to your industry a top priority. &nbsp;That is definitely the case here, given that the President chose to issue these orders just four days into his new Administration.\r\n\r\nBut it should be noted that, contrary to some headlines in the news media, neither order is a \"green light\" for the builders of these projects to simply begin moving pipe, backhoes and crews into place to restart construction. &nbsp;Both orders contain caveats, and both will involve procedural hurdles to be complied with and high-level decision making within multiple federal agencies. If a traffic signal analogy is to be drawn, the more appropriate one would be to compare the orders to flashing yellow lights signaling the pipeline companies to \"proceed with caution.\"\r\n\r\nLet's look at what each order actually does, and the next steps that will be involved:\r\n\r\n<strong>Keystone XL</strong> - The <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/24/presidential-memorandum-regarding-construction-keystone-xl-pipeline\" target=\"_blank\">President's order on Keystone XL</a> invites the operator, TransCanada, to reapply for its cross-border permit, and directs the U.S. State Department to \"take all actions necessary and appropriate to facilitate its expeditious review.\" &nbsp;The order further gives the State Department 60 days from receipt of TransCanada's new application to issue a final decision.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_496015128\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-496015128\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/496015128/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" data-height=\"687\" data-width=\"960\"> WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 06: U.S. President Barack Obama, flanked by Vice President Joe Biden (L) and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (R), announces his decision to reject the Keystone XL pipeline proposal, at the White House November 6, 2015 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThat's all positive, and after suffering through six years of delays lacking much, if any, merit from the Obama Administration, no doubt seems like a breath of fresh air to the company's executives. &nbsp;Indeed, the company confirmed later in the day that it had already begun preparing its new permit application.\r\n\r\nThe other caveat here is that, while the order itself is silent on the subject, President Trump said he would want to renegotiate some terms with TransCanada, specifically stating that he wants the company to use American-made steel in the construction. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer later simply said that the President \"wants the pipeline approved,\" so it is unclear how focused Mr. Trump will be on negotiating terms.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\nIn any event, [tweet_quote display=\"The State Department and TransCanada will still have administrative and legal hurdles to clear\"]the State Department and TransCanada will still have administrative and legal hurdles to clear[/tweet_quote] , and State will need to define a strong legal basis for reversing its previous order denying the permit, given that environmentalist groups will certainly file suit over any decision allowing the project to move forward.\r\n\r\nSo, not exactly a \"green light,\" but certainly a positive development for TransCanada after years of disappointment.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) -</strong>&nbsp;Given that DAPL is at a different point in the process than Keystone XL, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/24/presidential-memorandum-regarding-construction-dakota-access-pipeline\" target=\"_blank\">the executive order related to it</a> had to be drawn under different terms. As things currently stand, President Obama ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in December to perform another Environmental Impact Statement related to the project, ostensibly designed to explore alternative routes that would placate the ongoing protests conducted by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and a raft of outside protest groups that have latched on to the cause since last summer. In reality, this was basically President Obama's means of avoiding having to make a final decision on the project, punting it to the Trump Administration.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_43daf6c1a51544f996ab634efb7a4fd5\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-43daf6c1a51544f996ab634efb7a4fd5\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/43daf6c1a51544f996ab634efb7a4fd5/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" data-height=\"683\" data-width=\"960\"> Cornel West, right, speaks next to Chief Arvol Looking Horse, a spiritual leader of the Great Sioux Nation, during an interfaith ceremony at the Oceti Sakowin camp where people have gathered to protest the Dakota Access oil pipeline in Cannon Ball, N.D., Sunday, Dec. 4, 2016. (AP Photo/David Goldman)[/caption]\r\n\r\nPresident Trump obviously wants to make the decision, and made it clear on the campaign trail that he wants the project to be completed. &nbsp;His order yesterday was directed not to Energy Transfer Partners, the builder of the pipeline, but to the Army, ordering the Corps of Engineers to &ldquo;take all actions necessary and appropriate&rdquo; to conduct this review and approve the pipeline &ldquo;in an expedited manner... to the extent permitted by law and as warranted.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe key here is what actions by the Army are \"permitted by law and warranted\"? &nbsp;This could alternatively mean a) the conduct of the new EIS and the long administrative process related to it continues uninterrupted, b) the Corps of Engineers decides that the review is in fact unnecessary, halts the process, and orders the project to proceed under the existing permits and EIS, or c) Secretary of Defense James Mattis could issue a Secretarial Decision that halts the process and allows the project to move ahead.\r\n\r\nThe smart money here is most likely on option b) above, but just as with the State Department's decision making related to Keystone XL, the Defense Department and the Corps of Engineers will need to make sure whatever decision is made allowing the project to move forward stands on firm legal ground, in anticipation of the litigation that will surely come.\r\n\r\nSo again, not a \"green light,\" but a sure sign for Energy Transfer that there is indeed light at the end of this long tunnel.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\nFor the oil and gas industry as a whole, these executive orders, and the high priority they were given, is a signal that the major policy changes designed to stimulate domestic production talked about by candidate Trump during the campaign were not just the empty promises of your standard politician. As President Trump's transition team was fond of saying, if you want to know what he will do as President, all you have to do is read what he said during the campaign.\r\n<p class=\"tweet_line\">[tweet_quote display=\"There really is a new sheriff in town.\"]There really is a new sheriff in town.[/tweet_quote]</p>","description":"President Trump's executive orders related to the Keystone XL and Dakota Pipeline projects do not amount to 'green lights.'

(NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<p>The executive orders issued by President Donald Trump on Tuesday related to the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipeline projects were greeted with high praise by a domestic oil and gas industry that has become conditioned to expect nothing but bad news from the federal government over the past eight years. That reaction is certainly appropriate - it is always a good sign whenever any president makes taking positive steps related to your industry a top priority. &nbsp;That is definitely the case here, given that the President chose to issue these orders just four days into his new Administration.</p>\n<p>But it should be noted that, contrary to some headlines in the news media, neither order is a &quot;green light&quot; for the builders of these projects to simply begin moving pipe, backhoes and crews into place to restart construction. &nbsp;Both orders contain caveats, and both will involve procedural hurdles to be complied with and high-level decision making within multiple federal agencies. If a traffic signal analogy is to be drawn, the more appropriate one would be to compare the orders to flashing yellow lights signaling the pipeline companies to &quot;proceed with caution.&quot;</p>\n<p>Let's look at what each order actually does, and the next steps that will be involved:</p>\n<p><strong>Keystone XL</strong> - The <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/24/presidential-memorandum-regarding-construction-keystone-xl-pipeline\" target=\"_blank\">President's order on Keystone XL</a> invites the operator, TransCanada, to reapply for its cross-border permit, and directs the U.S. State Department to &quot;take all actions necessary and appropriate to facilitate its expeditious review.&quot; &nbsp;The order further gives the State Department 60 days from receipt of TransCanada's new application to issue a final decision.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_496015128\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-496015128\" src=\"//specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/496015128/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" data-height=\"687\" data-width=\"960\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 06: U.S. President Barack Obama, flanked by Vice President Joe Biden (L) and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (R), announces his decision to reject the Keystone XL pipeline proposal, at the White House November 6, 2015 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<p>That's all positive, and after suffering through six years of delays lacking much, if any, merit from the Obama Administration, no doubt seems like a breath of fresh air to the company's executives. &nbsp;Indeed, the company confirmed later in the day that it had already begun preparing its new permit application.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>The other caveat here is that, while the order itself is silent on the subject, President Trump said he would want to renegotiate some terms with TransCanada, specifically stating that he wants the company to use American-made steel in the construction. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer later simply said that the President &quot;wants the pipeline approved,&quot; so it is unclear how focused Mr. Trump will be on negotiating terms.</p>","<p>In any event, <span class=\"tweet_quote\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fdavidblackmon%2F2017%2F01%2F25%2Ftrump-executive-orders-on-dapl-and-keystone-proceed-with-caution%2F&amp;text=The%20State%20Department%20and%20TransCanada%20will%20still%20have%20administrative%20and%20legal%20hurdles%20to%20clear\" target=\"_blank\">the State Department and TransCanada will still have administrative and legal hurdles to clear<span></span></a></span> , and State will need to define a strong legal basis for reversing its previous order denying the permit, given that environmentalist groups will certainly file suit over any decision allowing the project to move forward.</p>\n<p>So, not exactly a &quot;green light,&quot; but certainly a positive development for TransCanada after years of disappointment.</p>\n<p><strong>Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) -</strong>&nbsp;Given that DAPL is at a different point in the process than Keystone XL, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/24/presidential-memorandum-regarding-construction-dakota-access-pipeline\" target=\"_blank\">the executive order related to it</a> had to be drawn under different terms. As things currently stand, President Obama ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in December to perform another Environmental Impact Statement related to the project, ostensibly designed to explore alternative routes that would placate the ongoing protests conducted by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and a raft of outside protest groups that have latched on to the cause since last summer. In reality, this was basically President Obama's means of avoiding having to make a final decision on the project, punting it to the Trump Administration.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_43daf6c1a51544f996ab634efb7a4fd5\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-43daf6c1a51544f996ab634efb7a4fd5\" src=\"//specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/43daf6c1a51544f996ab634efb7a4fd5/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" data-height=\"683\" data-width=\"960\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cornel West, right, speaks next to Chief Arvol Looking Horse, a spiritual leader of the Great Sioux Nation, during an interfaith ceremony at the Oceti Sakowin camp where people have gathered to protest the Dakota Access oil pipeline in Cannon Ball, N.D., Sunday, Dec. 4, 2016. (AP Photo/David Goldman)</p> \n</div>\n<p>President Trump obviously wants to make the decision, and made it clear on the campaign trail that he wants the project to be completed. &nbsp;His order yesterday was directed not to Energy Transfer Partners, the builder of the pipeline, but to the Army, ordering the Corps of Engineers to “take all actions necessary and appropriate” to conduct this review and approve the pipeline “in an expedited manner... to the extent permitted by law and as warranted.”</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>The key here is what actions by the Army are &quot;permitted by law and warranted&quot;? &nbsp;This could alternatively mean a) the conduct of the new EIS and the long administrative process related to it continues uninterrupted, b) the Corps of Engineers decides that the review is in fact unnecessary, halts the process, and orders the project to proceed under the existing permits and EIS, or c) Secretary of Defense James Mattis could issue a Secretarial Decision that halts the process and allows the project to move ahead.</p>\n<p>The smart money here is most likely on option b) above, but just as with the State Department's decision making related to Keystone XL, the Defense Department and the Corps of Engineers will need to make sure whatever decision is made allowing the project to move forward stands on firm legal ground, in anticipation of the litigation that will surely come.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>So again, not a &quot;green light,&quot; but a sure sign for Energy Transfer that there is indeed light at the end of this long tunnel.</p>","<p>For the oil and gas industry as a whole, these executive orders, and the high priority they were given, is a signal that the major policy changes designed to stimulate domestic production talked about by candidate Trump during the campaign were not just the empty promises of your standard politician. As President Trump's transition team was fond of saying, if you want to know what he will do as President, all you have to do is read what he said during the campaign.</p>\n<p class=\"tweet_line\"><span class=\"tweet_quote\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fdavidblackmon%2F2017%2F01%2F25%2Ftrump-executive-orders-on-dapl-and-keystone-proceed-with-caution%2F&amp;text=There%20really%20is%20a%20new%20sheriff%20in%20town.\" target=\"_blank\">There really is a new sheriff in town.<span></span></a></span></p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"doNotPaginate":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business","displayName":"Business"},{"id":"channel_1section_2","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Energy","url":"/energy","displayName":"Energy"},{"id":"channel_1section_7","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Washington","url":"/washington","displayName":"Washington"},{"id":"channel_2","channelName":"Investing","url":"/investing","displayName":"Investing"}],"pTagCount":16,"hashtags":["PowerUp"],"editorsPick":false,"numberOfImages":3,"relativeVideo":{"videoId":"5177346169001","title":"Saudi Oil Boss Pushes Cuts And Warns Of Shortfalls; Exxon's Tillerson Disagrees","playerId":"S1EBSbDn","keyValues":"displaysection=&fl=&channel=business,investing&swimlane=&specialslot=&section=business:energy,business:washington&id=blogAndPostId/blog/post/2488-3387&brand=&displaychannel=business","autoPlay":true},"digestDisabled":false,"brandVoiceTitle":"Trump's Pipeline Executive Orders: Proceed With Caution","allIndividualAuthors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/612050","name":"David Blackmon","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/davidblackmon/files/2016/08/David-Blackmon_avatar_1470435479-40x40.jpg"},{"size":62,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/davidblackmon/files/2016/08/David-Blackmon_avatar_1470435479-62x62.jpg"},{"size":136,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/davidblackmon/files/2016/08/David-Blackmon_avatar_1470435479-136x136.jpg"},{"size":400,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/davidblackmon/files/2016/08/David-Blackmon_avatar_1470435479-400x400.jpg"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/","primaryChannel":{"id":"channel_1","channelId":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","sectionId":"section_2","sectionName":"Energy","url":"/energy","shortName":"Energy","displayName":"Energy"},"type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/davidblackmon/","twitterName":"@GDBlackmon","authorType":"individual","facebookName":"David Blackmon","email":"david.blackmon@reagan.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about issues impacting the energy sector","webSite":"http://www.dbenergyadvisors.com","timestamp":1478728318453,"description":"David Blackmon is an independent public policy and communications consultant focused on energy-related issues.

</div>
<p>The executive orders issued by President Donald Trump on Tuesday related to the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipeline projects were greeted with high praise by a domestic oil and gas industry that has become conditioned to expect nothing but bad news from the federal government over the past eight years. That reaction is certainly appropriate - it is always a good sign whenever any president makes taking positive steps related to your industry a top priority. &nbsp;That is definitely the case here, given that the President chose to issue these orders just four days into his new Administration.</p>
<p>But it should be noted that, contrary to some headlines in the news media, neither order is a &quot;green light&quot; for the builders of these projects to simply begin moving pipe, backhoes and crews into place to restart construction. &nbsp;Both orders contain caveats, and both will involve procedural hurdles to be complied with and high-level decision making within multiple federal agencies. If a traffic signal analogy is to be drawn, the more appropriate one would be to compare the orders to flashing yellow lights signaling the pipeline companies to &quot;proceed with caution.&quot;</p>
<p>Let's look at what each order actually does, and the next steps that will be involved:</p>
<p><strong>Keystone XL</strong> - The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/24/presidential-memorandum-regarding-construction-keystone-xl-pipeline" target="_blank">President's order on Keystone XL</a> invites the operator, TransCanada, to reapply for its cross-border permit, and directs the U.S. State Department to &quot;take all actions necessary and appropriate to facilitate its expeditious review.&quot; &nbsp;The order further gives the State Department 60 days from receipt of TransCanada's new application to issue a final decision.</p>

<div id="attachment_496015128" class="wp-caption alignleft"> 
 <img class="dam-image getty size-large wp-image-496015128" src="//specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/496015128/960x0.jpg?fit=scale" data-height="687" data-width="960" />

</div>
<p>That's all positive, and after suffering through six years of delays lacking much, if any, merit from the Obama Administration, no doubt seems like a breath of fresh air to the company's executives. &nbsp;Indeed, the company confirmed later in the day that it had already begun preparing its new permit application.</p>
<div class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""></div>
<p>The other caveat here is that, while the order itself is silent on the subject, President Trump said he would want to renegotiate some terms with TransCanada, specifically stating that he wants the company to use American-made steel in the construction. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer later simply said that the President &quot;wants the pipeline approved,&quot; so it is unclear how focused Mr. Trump will be on negotiating terms.</p></div><div class="spinner preload-hidden" ng-if="!article.article && article.type === 'spinner'"><div class="bounce1"></div><div class="bounce2"></div><div class="bounce3"></div></div><div class="arrow bounce icon icon-chevron-down preload-hidden" ng-if="!!article.article && article.type === 'spinner'"></div></div><!-- Add Start Gallery Button --><div class="preload-hidden" ng-if="::(article.article.templateType === 'gallery')"><a class="btn-start-gallery" ng-href="{{::gallery_url}}" target="_self">Start Gallery</a></div><!-- Article Guest Contributor Bottom --><div class="article-guest-contrib clearfix preload-hidden" ng-if="article.article.guestContributor && article.article.guestContributor.position === 'bottom'" ng-include="" src="guest_contrib_template"></div><!-- Page controls --><div ng-if="article.article.pages.length > 1 && article.type === 'article'" class="article-pagination preload-hidden"><a ng-href="{{url_path}}{{url_prev}}{{ss}}" ng-if="article.article.page > 0" class="article-pagination-prev" target="_self"><i class="icon icon-chevron-left"></i></a> Page <strong>{{article.article.page + 1}}</strong> / <strong>{{article.article.pages.length}}</strong> <a ng-href="{{url_path}}{{url_next}}{{ss}}" ng-if="article.article.page < article.article.pages.length - 1" class="article-pagination-next" target="_self">Continue <i class="icon icon-chevron-right"></i></a></div><!-- THIS NEEDS TO MOVE FROM HERE --><div class="article-comment preload-hidden" ng-class="{'mobile-comment' : is_mobile}" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><a class="comments-link" ng-if="article.article.showComments" ng-click="openComments(article.index)" data-track="article-comment-this"><div class="comments-cta" ng-class="{'no-comments' : !article.article.calledOutCommentCount}"><div class="count"><strong>{{article.article.calledOutCommentCount||''}}</strong></div><span>Comment on this story</span></div></a></div><div article-sharing="" class="article-bottom-sharing article-sharing preload-hidden" data-track="body-bottom"></div><!-- Prints, Reprints & corrections bar --><div class="article-print-bar preload-hidden" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><ul><li class="print"><a ng-href="{{url_path}}print/" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-print"></i> <span>Print</span></a></li><li><a ng-click="openCorrectionsEmail()"><i class="icon icon-edit"></i> <span>Report Corrections</span></a></li><li><a href="http://forbesreprints.magreprints.com" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-terms"></i> <span>Reprints &amp; Permissions</span></a></li></ul></div><!-- Related ads--><div class="related-ads-container" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><!-- Media net related links --><div id="media_net_0_article_{{article.index}}" class="media_net_related_links initialized anim" article-related-links="{{article.index}}"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="speed-bump-wrapper" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><!-- Around the web ad --><div class="article-speed-bump" speed-bump=""></div></div></div></div><div ng-if="article.type === 'stream' && is_mobile && article.stream && article.stream.length > 0" id="article-bottom-stream" class="article-stream-container clearfix preload-hidden"><div class="article-stream-padding"><div ng-controller="ArticleStreamInlineController" class="clearfix"><h2 class="trending-header">Trending on <i class="logo icon icon-forbes-logo"><span>Forbes</span></i> {{channel_name}}</h2><section class="article-post-article"><div ng-include="" src="article_stream_template"></div></section></div></div></div></article></div><div intx-ad=""></div></section></div></div><div class="sticky-fbs-ad-container preload-hidden" ng-if="is_mobile && !no_ads_template"><div id="mobile-sticky" dynamic-ad-unit="mobile" class="ad mobile-sticky-fbs-ad anim"></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript">setTimeout(function() {
