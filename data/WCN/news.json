Founded over a century ago in 1914, Groot is the largest privately-owned solid waste services company in Illinois with total annual revenue of approximately $200 million. Groot serves approximately 300,000 customers primarily in northern Illinois from a network of six collection operations, six transfer stations and two recycling facilities. \"Groot is one of the most respected and best in class companies in our industry.
