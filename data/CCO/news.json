        "description": "[AFP] - Canadian uranium supplier Cameco's share price fell more than 12 percent in New York on Wednesday after the operator of the Fukushima plant in Japan canceled a Can$1.3 billion (US$1 billion) fuel supply contract. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Cameco said in a statement that it considers Tokyo Electric Power Co. to be in default after it rejected a delivery of uranium, and would sue. In its notice of termination, TEPCO cited government regulations arising from the Fukushima meltdown in March 2011 that prevented it from operating its nuclear generating plants over 18 months.",
