The securities industry's self-regulator found that the firms failed to keep hundreds of millions of electronic documents in a \"write once, read many\" format, which would have made it impossible to alter or destroy records after they were written. FINRA did not say documents had been changed but said the records were \"pivotal to the firms' brokerage businesses,\" and that it relies on these files to ensure firms are following securities laws.",
