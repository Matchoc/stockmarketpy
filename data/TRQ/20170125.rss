The fee was imposed following a diplomatic row sparked by last week's visit of Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, to Ulaanbaatar. The Dalai Lama is cherished as a spiritual leader in predominantly Buddhist Mongolia, but China regards him as a dangerous separatist and warned the visit could damage bilateral relations.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">yahoo_finance/2881937551</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2016 14:02:16 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
