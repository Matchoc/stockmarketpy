        "description": "[AAP] - A massive wildfire burning around the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray, Alberta, is about a kilometre away from Enbridge Inc's Cheecham crude oil tank farm, but is under control for now, emergency officials say. The blaze near the tank farm was stable because the wind was co-operating as Enbridge's industrial firefighters tackled the blaze, the officials said at a news conference on Monday. The entire population of Fort McMurray, about 90,000 people, were forced to flee the Canadian city nearly two weeks ago as the uncontrolled wildfire raged through some neighbourhoods and destroyed about 15 per cent of structures.",
