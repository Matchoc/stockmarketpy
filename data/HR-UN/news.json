        "description": "[Reuters] - TORONTO/MONTREAL, Nov 18 (Reuters) - German real estate investment firm KanAm Grund Group has put up for sale two office buildings in Montreal that could fetch about C$400 million ($296 million) to C$450 million, according to two sources familiar with the situation. KanAm spokesman Michael Birnbaum did not comment on the sale process. The buildings are expected to be sold at a low capitalization rate for the Montreal market, indicating that demand for high-quality office buildings is spilling over from Toronto and Vancouver.",
