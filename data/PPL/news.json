The Project entails the construction of approximately 145 kilometres of 12-inch diametre pipeline with a base design capacity of up to 75,000 barrels per day that will parallel much of the existing Blueberry pipeline system northwest of Taylor, B.C. to the Highway/Blair Creek area of B.C. The NEBC Expansion will provide a conduit for natural gas liquids and condensate produced in the liquids-rich Montney resource play to access the Company's downstream pipeline systems that feed into markets in the Edmonton and Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta area.",
